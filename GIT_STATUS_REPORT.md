## 🔧 **NEXT STEPS**

If issues persist with tour requests:

2. **Verify Home Data:** Ensure homes exist in the database with correct IDs
3. **Test with Different Homes:** Try requesting tours for different home IDs
4. **Check Browser Console:** Look for any client-side JavaScript errors

If issues with other endpoints (like `/api/family/match`):
1. **Check specific endpoint logs** in Render dashboard
2. **Review error stack traces** for root cause
3. **Verify database schema** matches code expectations
