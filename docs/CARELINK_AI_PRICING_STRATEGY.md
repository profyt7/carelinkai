**Status:** Strategic Planning

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive pricing strategy for CareLink AI, a senior care marketplace platform connecting families, care operators, caregivers, and discharge planners. Based on competitive analysis and industry research, we recommend a **Hybrid Revenue Model** combining subscription-based pricing for operators with lead generation fees and optional premium features for other personas.

**Key Recommendations:**
- **Primary Revenue Source:** Operator subscriptions ($49-$299/month)
- **Secondary Revenue:** Lead generation fees from high-intent referrals ($50-$150 per qualified lead)
- **Launch Strategy:** 2-month free beta → Grandfather pricing for early adopters
- **Target Break-Even:** Month 8-10 with 30-40 paying operators

## Section 1: Pricing Model Analysis

### 1.1 Commission-Based Model (Traditional Referral Agency)

**How It Works:** Charge operators 50-100% of the first month's rent when a resident moves in.

#### Pros

- ✅ **High Revenue Per Transaction:** $3,000-$8,000 per placement

- ✅ **Proven Conversion:** Operators understand this model

#### Cons
- ❌ **Long Sales Cycle:** Takes 30-90 days from lead to move-in to payment
- ❌ **Unpredictable Revenue:** Lumpy cash flow, hard to forecast
- ❌ **High Friction:** Operators track duplicate leads, dispute fees
- ❌ **Requires Scale:** Need high volume to generate consistent revenue
- ❌ **Legal Complexity:** Anti-kickback considerations, state regulations (TX, OK ban percentage-based fees)

**Revenue Potential:** $150K-$500K annually (with 50-150 placements)

**Market Fit:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Strong but requires significant scale

**Implementation Complexity:** 🔴 High - Legal contracts, payment tracking, dispute resolution

**Time to Revenue:** 🔴 90-120 days from launch

---

### 1.2 Subscription Model (SaaS for Operators)

## Section 8: Pricing Psychology & Optimization

### 8.1 Psychological Pricing Tactics

**Charm Pricing:** $49 (not $50), $149 (not $150)
- Research shows prices ending in 9 convert 5-10% better

**Anchor Pricing:** Show annual pricing first with "SAVE 20%" badge
- Makes monthly pricing seem less intimidating
- Encourages annual commitment (better cash flow)

**Tiered Framing:**
```
Basic: "Get Started" (entry point)
Professional: "Most Popular" ⭐ (social proof + value)
Enterprise: "Best Value" (premium positioning)
```

**Loss Aversion:** "Lock in Founding Member pricing before it's gone"
- Creates urgency, fear of missing out

**Decoy Pricing:** Basic at $49 makes Professional at $149 look reasonable
- Middle tier drives 60-70% of revenue (proven SaaS pattern)

### 8.2 Free Trial vs. Freemium

**Recommendation: FREE BETA → PAID (No Free Tier Long-Term)**

**Why No Freemium?**
- ❌ Infrastructure costs supporting free users
- ❌ Low conversion rates (1-10% typical)
- ❌ Delayed revenue (6-12 months)
- ❌ Not sustainable for solo founder

**Alternative: 14-Day Free Trial (After Beta)**
- ✅ Low-friction way to experience value
- ✅ Higher conversion rates (15-25% for free trials)
- ✅ Requires credit card (pre-qualifies serious users)
- ✅ Automated email sequence during trial

**Trial Conversion Tactics:**
- Day 1: Welcome email + quick start guide
- Day 3: "Have you created your listing?" (nudge)
- Day 7: Success story from beta user (social proof)
- Day 10: "Only 4 days left - here's what you'll lose" (loss aversion)
- Day 14: Last chance email with special offer

### 8.3 Annual vs Monthly Pricing

**Discount Structure:**
- Monthly: Full price ($49, $149, $299)
- Annual: 20% discount ($470, $1,430, $2,870)

**Why 20% Discount?**
- ✅ Standard in SaaS (15-20% is typical)
- ✅ Equivalent to 2 months free (12-month commitment)
- ✅ Strong incentive without sacrificing too much revenue

**Benefits of Annual Plans:**
- Cash flow: $1,430 upfront vs $149/month × 12
- Lower churn: Annual subscribers 30-50% less likely to cancel
- Higher LTV: Longer commitment = more opportunity for upsells

**Solo Founder Strategy:**
- Push annual in sales conversations
- Offer payment plan: $1,430/year or 3 payments of $500
- Use annual revenue for platform improvements, marketing

### 8.4 Money-Back Guarantee

**30-Day Money-Back Guarantee (All Plans)**

**Why Offer This?**
- ✅ Removes buyer risk/hesitation
- ✅ Increases conversion rates (10-20% lift)
- ✅ Shows confidence in product
- ✅ Industry standard expectation

**Refund Policy:**
```
"Try CareLink AI risk-free for 30 days. If you don't receive at least 
3 qualified leads or aren't satisfied with the platform, we'll refund 
100% of your subscription—no questions asked."
```

**Expected Refund Rate:** 2-5% (industry average)

### 9.3 When to Raise Prices

**Indicators to Raise Prices:**
- ✅ 80%+ of new sign-ups choose Professional or Enterprise
- ✅ Less than 10% of trials convert to Basic
- ✅ Strong product-market fit (NPS > 40)
- ✅ Added significant new features (AI calling, advanced analytics)
- ✅ Market validation (100+ paying operators)

**How to Raise Prices:**
- Grandfather existing customers at current rates (loyalty)
- Announce 30-60 days in advance
- Tie increase to new features/value added
- Position as "invest in growth" not "cash grab"
- Example: "New AI features justify $59 → $69 Basic tier"

**When NOT to Raise Prices:**
- ❌ Before 50 paying customers
- ❌ During slow growth periods (looks desperate)
- ❌ Without adding new value
- ❌ More than once per year

## Section 11: Pricing FAQs (For Operators)

### Q: Why should I pay monthly when competitors only charge when I get a resident?

**A:** Great question! Here's the math:
- Traditional agencies: $5,000-$8,000 per placement
- CareLink AI Professional: $149/month = $1,788/year
- **Break-even:** Just 1 placement every 3-4 months
- **Savings:** 93% cost reduction if you get 5+ placements/year

Plus, you get:
- Unlimited access to families browsing right now
- Direct relationships (no middleman)
- Predictable budgeting (no surprise $5K fees)
- Tools to market yourself 24/7

### Q: What if I don't get any leads?

**A:** We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't receive at least 3 qualified leads in your first month, we'll refund 100%. No questions asked.

Plus, we provide:
- Onboarding call to optimize your listing
- Best practices guide (how to convert leads)
- Monthly performance reviews
- Profile optimization tips

### Q: Can I try it before committing?

**A:** Absolutely! After our beta period, we offer a 14-day free trial (credit card required). This gives you full access to test the platform and see real leads before paying.

Beta users also get exclusive Founding Member pricing (30% off Year 1).

### Q: What happens if I cancel?

**A:** You can cancel anytime, no long-term contracts. If you cancel:
- You keep access until the end of your billing period
- Your listings are deactivated
- You can reactivate anytime (pricing may change)
- We export your data (leads, messages) if requested

### Q: How do I know leads are "qualified"?

**A:** Our AI pre-qualifies leads based on:
- Budget match (their range fits your pricing)
- Care level match (you offer the services they need)
- Location preference (within their desired area)
- Move-in timeline (actively looking, not just browsing)

You can also set your own qualification criteria in your dashboard.

### Q: Do you charge per lead on top of the subscription?

**A:** No! Your subscription includes leads (5/month Basic, 15/month Professional, Unlimited Enterprise).

**Optional:** You can purchase Premium Lead Credits ($10 each) for ultra-high-intent leads (families looking to move within 30 days, fully pre-qualified). These are bonus leads on top of your plan.

### Q: What if I run multiple facilities?

**A:** Professional plan includes up to 3 listings, Enterprise includes unlimited.

- 1 facility: Basic ($49/month)
- 2-3 facilities: Professional ($149/month)
- 4+ facilities: Enterprise ($299/month)

Each listing is fully customizable with its own profile, pricing, and messaging.

## Conclusion

This pricing strategy balances **bootstrap-friendly predictable revenue** (subscriptions) with **performance-based upside** (premium leads). By keeping families free and charging operators a fair, transparent price, CareLink AI can compete effectively against traditional high-commission agencies while building sustainable MRR.

**The key to success:** Focus on delivering 5-10x ROI for operators ($149/month subscription should generate $750-$1,500+ in value through placements). When operators succeed, they stay, expand, and refer others—creating a flywheel of growth.

**Remember:** Pricing is not set in stone. Stay close to customers, iterate based on feedback, and optimize over time. The best pricing strategy is one that evolves with your business.
