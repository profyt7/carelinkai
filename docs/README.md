## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to read all 150+ pages before starting?
**A:** No! Start with Quick Start Guide (10 min read), execute Day 1 tasks (8 hours), then reference other documents as needed. The Final Master Launch Plan is meant to be referenced throughout the 52 weeks, not read cover-to-cover upfront.

---

### Q: Which document is most important?
**A:** For Day 1: **QUICK_START_GUIDE.md**. For comprehensive strategy: **CARELINK_AI_FINAL_MASTER_LAUNCH_PLAN.md**. For ensuring you don't miss anything: **LAUNCH_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md**. All three are critical but serve different purposes.

---

### Q: How often should I refer back to these documents?
**A:** 
- **Daily:** Quick Start Guide (Week 1), Execution Roadmap (current week section)
- **Weekly:** Check Launch Readiness Checklist, review metrics from Revenue Projections
- **Monthly:** Review full month's plan, compare actuals vs projections
- **As-Needed:** Pricing Strategy (when customers ask), Automation Guide (when setting up), Risk Management (when issues arise)

---

### Q: What if the plan isn't working?
**A:** 
1. Review **Decision Points & Checkpoints** (Final Master Launch Plan, Part 8)
2. Check **Risk Management & Contingency Plans** (Final Master Launch Plan, Part 9)
3. Conduct customer interviews (ask what's not working)
4. Adjust plan based on data (all plans are living documents)
5. Remember: Every successful startup pivots. Flexibility > rigid adherence to plan.

---

### Q: Can I share these documents with co-founders/team?
**A:** Yes! These documents are designed to be collaborative. If you bring on a co-founder or hire team members, share relevant sections:
- Co-founder: Full access to all documents
- Virtual Assistant: AUTOMATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md, relevant sections of Execution Roadmap
- Sales hire: Customer Acquisition Plans, Sales Scripts, Pricing Strategy
- Customer Success: Beta-to-Paid Conversion, Email Templates, Support workflows

---

### Q: How do I stay updated if documents change?
**A:** Check the "Last Updated" date at the top of each document. Major updates will include version numbers (v1.0, v2.0, etc.). The Final Master Launch Plan is considered **FINAL v2.0** and should not need major revisions unless significant business model changes occur.

---

### Q: What if I want to adjust the budget?
**A:** The plans show $2,500 (ultra-lean) and $4,900 (optimized) annual budgets. To adjust:
1. Review **Budget Breakdown** (Final Master Launch Plan, Part 7)
2. Modify tools allocation (upgrade/downgrade tiers)
3. Adjust paid ads budget (increase or eliminate)
4. Update spreadsheet with your numbers
5. Recalculate break-even point

---

### Q: Where are the original 3 acquisition documents mentioned?
**A:** The user mentioned "Original 3 acquisition documents (Caregiver, Marketing Playbook, AI Automation)" but these weren't found in the docs folder. Their content has been integrated into the **FINAL Master Launch Plan Part 3: Customer Acquisition** which covers all 4 personas comprehensively. If you have separate acquisition documents, they can be added to this library.
