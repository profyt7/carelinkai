### How to use
1. Run `npm run seed` (or `pnpm seed`) after your database is up.  
2. Start the dev server and go to the auth login page.  
3. Choose any account above to explore that user experience.

### Tips
* Check or modify seeded data anytime in **Prisma Studio** (`npx prisma studio` → http://localhost:5557).  
* To keep your own accounts, ensure the `clearDatabase()` line in `prisma/seed.ts` remains _commented out_.  
* If you re-run the seed script with `clearDatabase()` enabled, it **deletes all existing data**, including manually-created users.  
* Feel free to add more demo users—just update the seed file accordingly.

Happy testing! 🚀
