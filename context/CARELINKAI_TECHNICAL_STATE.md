## Transport — Phase 4: NEMT Anti-Fraud + Reliability Score (as of 2026-05-05)
- **Trip verification:** `actualPickupAt` / `actualDropoffAt` set server-side on status transitions (`/api/rides/[id]/start` + `/complete`). Driver cannot edit. Supports Medicaid claim data.
- **No-show accountability:** `noShowCausedBy` on Ride (PROVIDER/RIDER/FACILITY/WEATHER/OTHER). Cancel modal collects cause when status is IN_PROGRESS. Stored via PATCH `/api/rides/[id]`.
- **Recurring ride auto-scheduler:** Cron `GET /api/cron/recurring-rides` (`0 7 * * *`). Finds all seed rides (`isRecurring=true, recurringRootId=null`), spawns children 14 days ahead. Respects `recurringEndDate`. Return trip offset preserved.
- **Provider reliability score:** `src/lib/rideStats.ts` — transport-only gate, weighted 60% completion + 40% on-time. `scoreLabel()` returns Excellent/Very Good/Good/Fair/Needs Work with color classes. Provider dashboard: 4th tile + Ride Dispatch quick action (PROVIDER+transport only). Marketplace detail: progress bars in Transport Capabilities block. API: `rideStats` field in `/api/marketplace/providers/[id]` response.

## Transport — Phase 3: Manifest, Shared Rides, Capacity (as of 2026-05-04)
- **Provider manifest view:** `/rides` page redesigned for PROVIDER role — day-grouped cards showing time, passenger name, route, status badge, collapsible detail (contact, purpose, return/recurring, fare). PassengerNeedsRow shows NEMT tags (mobility level, door level, O₂, companion, cognition, service animal, wait time). Day-level CapacityBar (green→amber→red) vs `vehicleCapacity`.
- **Batch opportunity detection:** Client-side — rides within 90 min of each other going to same destination flagged with amber "Batch possible" banner at the day level and gold star on individual cards.
- **Shared rides:** `isSharedRide Boolean` + `sharedRideGroupId String?` on Ride model. Family can opt in at booking (step 2 of RideRequestModal). Provider can toggle per card in manifest. `PATCH /api/rides/[id]/shared` endpoint. Migration: `20260504000005`.
- **Vehicle capacity:** `vehicleCapacity Int @default(4)` on Provider. Editable in `/settings/provider` (Vehicle & Capacity section). Returned by `GET /api/rides` for PROVIDER role. Used by CapacityBar in manifest.

## Transport — Full End-to-End Booking (Phase 2 — as of 2026-05-04)
- **Phase 1 (complete):** Provider transport fields (`rideTypes[]`, `wheelchairAccessible`, `acceptsMedicaid`, `serviceRadius`), marketplace filters, inquiry form trip details, provider detail transport section.
- **Ride model:** `Ride` table with full lifecycle enum `REQUESTED → CONFIRMED → PAID → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED → CANCELED`. Fields: `familyId?`, `operatorId?`, `providerId`, `residentName?`, `bookedByRole` (FAMILY/OPERATOR), `baseFare`, `platformFeePercent` (default 12%), `platformFee`, `totalAmount`, `stripePaymentIntentId`, `stripeCheckoutSessionId`, `canceledBy`, `cancelReason`. Migrations: `20260504000001` (Ride model) + `20260504000002` (operator fields, nullable familyId).
- **API routes:** `POST/GET /api/rides` (book + list, role-scoped), `GET/PATCH /api/rides/[id]` (view + cancel + Stripe refund if PAID), `POST /api/rides/[id]/confirm` (provider sets fare), `POST /api/rides/[id]/pay` (Stripe Checkout), `POST /api/rides/[id]/start` (PAID→IN_PROGRESS), `POST /api/rides/[id]/complete` (IN_PROGRESS→COMPLETED).
- **Stripe integration:** Checkout Session with `metadata.type="RIDE_PAYMENT"`; webhook handler in `/api/webhooks/stripe` sets status→PAID + stores `stripePaymentIntentId`; PAID cancellations trigger `stripe.refunds.create()`.
- **Email notifications:** Provider notified on new booking; family notified when confirmed (with payment link); provider notified when ride paid; booker (family or operator) notified on completion; cancellation emails to opposing party.
- **Cron:** `GET /api/cron/ride-reminders` — sends reminder emails to booker + provider for rides within 23–25h window. Protected by `CRON_SECRET`. Render cron added by Chris.
- **UI:** `/rides` management page with role-adaptive views (provider: Confirm/Decline/Start/Complete; family/operator: Pay/Cancel); `RideRequestModal` with resident name field for operators; `BookTransportButton` on resident detail page; "Book Ride for Resident" button on provider detail page.
- **Nav:** "My Rides" sidebar nav item added for FAMILY + PROVIDER roles.
- **Admin:** Transport commissions (12% platform fee × completed rides MTD) in 7th MRR tile on admin dashboard.

## Known Issues (as of 2026-05-02)
1. Demo accounts use test Stripe data — when switching to live Stripe, all operator `stripeCustomerId` fields must be cleared and operators re-subscribed
2. seed-demo.ts `update:{}` bug fixed for all 7 top-level user accounts; nested operator/caregiver/etc upserts still use `update:{}`
3. **One-time production action needed:** Admin must click "Fix Demo Caregiver Employment" in Admin Tools (`/admin/tools`) on production to link demo caregivers to the demo operator in the production DB — otherwise Operator caregiver tab shows blank
4. Landing page still uses some raw hex literals (`#3978FC`, `#7253B7`) in inline styles — cosmetic only
5. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` console warning — SSE works fine, no WebSocket server configured (not blocking anything)

## Pending Deployment Actions (before subscription billing goes live)
1. **Merge branch to main** — triggers Render auto-deploy
2. **Apply migration** — run `npx prisma migrate deploy` in Render shell (or verify auto-migration on deploy). Migration: `20260424000000_add_operator_subscription_fields`
3. **Create Stripe Products** — in Stripe dashboard, create recurring monthly prices: Starter ($99), Professional ($249), Growth ($499)
4. **Set env vars in Render:**
   - `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER` = price_xxx (from Stripe dashboard)
   - `STRIPE_PRICE_PROFESSIONAL` = price_xxx
   - `STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH` = price_xxx
5. **Register Stripe webhook** — in Stripe dashboard, add endpoint: `https://getcarelinkai.com/api/webhooks/stripe` with events: `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`
6. **Configure Customer Portal** — in Stripe dashboard under Billing > Customer Portal: enable cancel subscription, update payment method, update billing info

## Stripe Key Swappability
Architecture is env-var-only. When the current test Stripe account is replaced:
1. Update `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Render
2. Re-create Products/Prices in the new Stripe account
3. Update `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER`, `STRIPE_PRICE_PROFESSIONAL`, `STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH` in Render
4. Re-register webhook endpoint in new Stripe account
Zero code changes required.

## Deployment Notes
- Render auto-deploys on push to `main`
- After any schema change, verify `npx prisma migrate status` in Render shell
- Build warnings (missing STRIPE_KEY) are expected during build — dummy keys at build time, real keys at runtime

## Revenue Model
See `REVENUE_MODEL.md` for the full breakdown. 12 streams finalized:
1. **Operator SaaS subscription** (PRIMARY) — $99/$249/$499/mo — **checkout now wired**
2. Family placement/referral fee — one-time on conversion
3. Caregiver marketplace placement fee — per-hire
4. Discharge Planner SaaS — per-seat hospital subscription
5. Featured listings — $49-$99/mo add-on
6. Care Wallet transaction fee — 2-3% on care bill payments (highest long-term potential)
7-12. (Providers marketplace, Affiliate, Assessments, Document AI, Data/Analytics, API)

## Playwright E2E Test Suite
- Config: `playwright.config.ts` — auto-starts dev server, 1 worker, retries on failure
- Auth helpers: `tests/helpers/auth.ts` — login with 3-attempt retry, cookie consent pre-set
- Bug verification: `tests/bug-verification.spec.ts` — covers Bugs 1-3
- Operator onboarding: `tests/operator-onboarding.spec.ts` — 10 steps covering full operator journey
- Run: `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers npx playwright test --workers=1`
- Local limitation: Prisma binary engine in sandbox dies after ~7 tests due to thread limits. NOT a production issue.

## Design System (as of 2026-04-25)
- **Fonts:** Inter (sans/display/heading via `--font-inter`), DM Serif Display (serif/hero via `--font-dm-serif`)
- **Color tokens:** Fully unified across all 259 source files. Design system tokens only: `primary-*`, `neutral-*`, `error-*`, `success-*`, `warning-*`, `secondary-*`. No raw `red-*`/`green-*`/`blue-*`/`gray-*`/`purple-*` in any component (except `src/app/page.tsx` landing page, intentionally deferred).
- **Components polished:** StatCard (left-border accent + trend), skeleton-loader (shimmer + HomeCardSkeleton), tabs (real tokens), breadcrumbs, confirm-dialog, error, not-found, login page, search page.

## Provider Credentialing + Compliance (as of 2026-05-05)
- **Provider credentials CRUD:** `ProviderCredential` model (already in schema). `GET/POST /api/provider/credentials`, `DELETE /api/provider/credentials/[id]`. Status lifecycle: PENDING → VERIFIED / REJECTED / EXPIRED. Providers can upload background check, drug test, CPR cert, vehicle inspection, insurance, driver's license, NEMT license, other.
- **Provider credentials UI:** `/settings/provider/credentials` — status tabs, add form, expiry date, doc URL, notes. Certified banner when 3+ VERIFIED. CareLinkAI Certified badge on ProviderCard + provider detail page when verifiedCredentialCount >= 3.
- **Admin credentials queue:** `GET /api/admin/provider-credentials?status=PENDING&limit=100` — list endpoint across all providers. `/admin/credentials` — queue UI with status tabs (PENDING/VERIFIED/REJECTED/EXPIRED/ALL), one-click Verify, Reject with optional reason prompt. Links to `/admin/providers/[id]`. Quick-action card added to admin dashboard.
- **Credential expiry cron:** `GET /api/cron/credential-expiry` — marks EXPIRED, deactivates providers with critical expired types (BG check, insurance, vehicle inspection, NEMT license), sends 30-day warning emails via Resend. Chris registered Render cron `0 6 * * *`.
- **Provider onboarding welcome email:** Fires after PROVIDER registration (fire-and-forget). 3 steps: complete profile → upload credentials → activate listing. Links corrected to `/settings/provider`, `/settings/provider/credentials`, `/settings/provider/billing`.
- **Provider profile completeness checklist:** 8-step progress widget on provider dashboard. Shows % complete + progress bar + per-item checklist with direct CTAs. Disappears when all 8 steps done. Credentials quick-action tile added (shows X/3 verified).

## Immediate Next Priorities
1. **Merge feat/provider-onboarding-checklist → main** — provider completeness widget + welcome email link fix.
2. **OL-036 production action** — demo provider at `demo.provider@carelinkai.test` must re-save Settings → Profile to migrate service type slugs from underscore to hyphen format.
3. **Switch Stripe to live mode** — swap all `STRIPE_*` env vars to live keys in Render, re-register webhook, create live Products/Prices. Runbook: `context/STRIPE_SETUP_RUNBOOK.md`.
4. **Set Checkr live keys** — `CHECKR_API_KEY` + `CHECKR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Render once account approved (OL-023).
5. **Run Playwright smoke tests** across all 7 demo roles: `npm run test:e2e:prod`. New `tests/ride-booking.spec.ts` covers transport + credentials flows.
6. **OL-044 Guaranteed Ride SLA** — needs 3+ providers in market first before building fallback network.
