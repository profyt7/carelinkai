## 🔴 Critical (Blocking Revenue / Demos)

### OL-001: Demo accounts not seeded in production
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED (2026-04-22)
- **All 7 accounts active in production (Password: DemoUser123!):**
  - demo.family@carelinkai.test (FAMILY)
  - demo.operator@carelinkai.test (OPERATOR)
  - demo.aide@carelinkai.test (CAREGIVER)
  - demo.provider@carelinkai.test (PROVIDER)
  - demo.admin@carelinkai.test (ADMIN)
  - demo.healthcare@carelinkai.test (DISCHARGE_PLANNER)
  - demo.affiliate@carelinkai.test (AFFILIATE)

### OL-002: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set in Render
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED (2026-04-22) — Chris confirmed key is set in Render dashboard
- **Done:** CareBot, inquiry AI, document classification, discharge planner, match explainer all live

### OL-004: Revenue model not finalized / Stripe billing not wired
- **Status:** ✅ FULLY VERIFIED END-TO-END (2026-04-25)
- Operator checkout → trial → portal → plan switching → webhook → DB all confirmed working in test mode
- In-app plan switching built (upgrade/downgrade without Stripe portal redirect)
- Admin revenue dashboard live: MRR, placement fees, affiliate commissions, recent payments, subscription breakdown
- **Remaining before live revenue:** Switch to live Stripe account (runbook: `context/STRIPE_SETUP_RUNBOOK.md`)

### OL-007: Full end-to-end operator onboarding never verified
- **Status:** ✅ CLOSED (2026-04-23) — all 10 steps verified in production
- All steps passing in production on getcarelinkai.com

### OL-008: Stripe subscription billing not wired (operators)
- **Status:** ✅ CODE COMPLETE (2026-04-24) — merged into OL-004 above
- See OL-004 for remaining deployment steps

---

## 🟡 Important (Quality / Stability)

### OL-005: TypeScript strict mode errors
- **Status:** ✅ CLOSED (2026-04-24) — 0 errors, `npm run type-check` passes clean

### OL-006: CI quality workflow type-check step disabled
- **Status:** ✅ CLOSED (2026-04-24) — type-check step re-enabled in `.github/workflows/quality.yml`

---

## 🟢 Low Priority / Future

### OL-013: CareBot outputs raw markdown in chat
- **Status:** ✅ CLOSED (2026-04-24) — added plain text instruction to SYSTEM_PROMPT in `src/app/api/carebot/chat/route.ts`

### OL-009: SMS (Twilio) not implemented
- **Status:** ✅ CLOSED (2026-04-24) — 5 triggers live via SMSService
- Operator: new inquiry, tour booked, payment failed
- Family: inquiry response received, tour reminder 24hr (Render cron daily 9am)
- All calls non-blocking; gracefully no-ops if Twilio not configured

### OL-010: Invoice model missing from schema
- **Status:** No Prisma model for invoices
- **Impact:** Cannot generate invoices for operators
- **Fix:** Add Invoice model; generate on Stripe subscription payment (invoice.payment_succeeded webhook event)

### OL-011: Playwright tests configured for localhost only
- **Status:** Tests can't run against production
- **Impact:** No automated regression testing post-deploy
- **Fix:** Create a separate Playwright config for production environment

### OL-012: context/ files were not in repo
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED (2026-04-21)

### OL-014: Placement fee not auto-triggered on Convert to Resident
- **Status:** ✅ CLOSED + IMPROVED (2026-04-24) — switched from PaymentIntent (blocks if card fails) to Stripe invoice item (collected on next billing cycle); never blocks conversion
- Payment status: PENDING → PROCESSING (invoice queued) → COMPLETED (invoice paid via webhook)
- Defaults to $500 (`PLACEMENT_FEE_CENTS=50000`); configurable per Render env var

### OL-015: Landing page does not showcase all products by user type
- **Status:** ✅ CLOSED (2026-04-24) — full landing page revamp with 6-tab user-type sections, pricing cards, roadmap
