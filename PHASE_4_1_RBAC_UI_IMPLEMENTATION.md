# Phase 4.1: RBAC UI Implementation - CareLinkAI

**Status**: ✅ In Progress  
**Date**: December 9, 2025  
**Branch**: main  

---

## Overview

Phase 4.1 implements permission-based UI components across the CareLinkAI application, building on top of the Phase 4 RBAC core system. This phase focuses on making the UI respect user permissions and roles, providing appropriate visual feedback for different user types.

## Permission Patterns Used

### 1. **PermissionGuard Component**
```tsx
<PermissionGuard permission={PERMISSIONS.RESIDENTS_CREATE}>
  <button>Create Resident</button>
</PermissionGuard>
```

### 2. **ActionGuard Component**
```tsx
<ActionGuard resourceType="assessment" action="create">
  <button>New Assessment</button>
</ActionGuard>
```

### 3. **RoleGuard Component**
```tsx
<RoleGuard 
  roles={["ADMIN", "OPERATOR"]}
  fallback={<div>Restricted Access Message</div>}
>
  <ComplianceContent />
</RoleGuard>
```

### 4. **Permission Guard with Fallback**
```tsx
<PermissionGuard 
  permission={PERMISSIONS.RESIDENTS_UPDATE}
  fallback={
    <button disabled className="cursor-not-allowed">
      View Only
    </button>
  }
>
  <button>Edit</button>
</PermissionGuard>
```

## Role-Based UI Behavior

### ADMIN
- ✅ Full access to all features
- ✅ Can create, edit, delete all resources
- ✅ Can view compliance information
- ✅ Can manage operators

### OPERATOR
- ✅ Full access to their scope (homes/residents)
- ✅ Can create, edit, delete within their scope
- ✅ Can view compliance information
- ✅ Cannot manage other operators

### CAREGIVER
- ✅ Can view residents
- ✅ Can create assessments and incidents (limited)
- ✅ Cannot edit/delete assessments or incidents
- ✅ Cannot view compliance information
- ✅ Read-only on most features

### FAMILY
- ✅ Can view their family member's information only
- ✅ **"View Only" badge displayed prominently**
- ✅ No edit/delete permissions
- ✅ Cannot view compliance information
- ✅ Cannot view other residents

---

## Visual Indicators

### 1. **Read-Only Badges**
- Amber-colored badge for family members: "View Only"
- Displayed at the top of resident detail pages
- Includes eye icon (FiEye)

### 2. **Disabled Buttons**
- Buttons show as disabled when user lacks permissions
- Cursor changes to "not-allowed"
- Tooltips explain why action is restricted

### 3. **Restricted Access Messages**
- Full-page message for compliance tab (non-admin/operator users)
- Shield icon (FiShield) for security-related restrictions
- Clear, user-friendly language

### 4. **Missing Action Buttons**
- Buttons completely hidden for unauthorized users (when using ActionGuard without fallback)
- Cleaner UI without disabled elements

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

#### As ADMIN:
- [ ] Can see all buttons (Create, Edit, Delete)
- [ ] Can access all tabs including Compliance
- [ ] Can perform all CRUD operations
- [ ] No "View Only" badges shown

#### As OPERATOR:
- [ ] Can see all buttons within their scope
- [ ] Can access Compliance tab
- [ ] Can perform CRUD operations on their homes/residents
- [ ] No "View Only" badges shown

#### As CAREGIVER:
- [ ] Can view residents
- [ ] Can create assessments/incidents
- [ ] Cannot edit/delete assessments/incidents (buttons hidden)
- [ ] Cannot access Compliance tab (shows restricted message)
- [ ] No "View Only" badge (not applicable)

#### As FAMILY:
- [ ] **"View Only" badge displayed prominently**
- [ ] Can view their family member only
- [ ] All edit/delete buttons hidden or disabled
- [ ] Compliance tab shows restricted access message
- [ ] Summary PDF button still accessible

---

## API Integration

All permission checks are enforced at both:
1. **UI Level** (Phase 4.1) - Hide/disable buttons, show badges
2. **API Level** (Phase 4) - Server-side authorization using `requirePermission()`, `requireResidentAccess()`, etc.

This dual-layer approach ensures:
- Better UX (no confusing unauthorized errors)
- Security (server validates all requests)
- Consistency (permission definitions shared between UI and API)

---

## Performance Considerations

- Permission checks use React hooks with minimal re-renders
- `usePermissions()` hook caches permissions for the session
- Guard components only render when permissions change
- No additional API calls for permission checks (uses session data)

---

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run TypeScript compilation: `npm run build`
- [ ] Verify no type errors
- [ ] Test with different user roles in development
- [ ] Review all modified files

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Smoke test with each role (ADMIN, OPERATOR, CAREGIVER, FAMILY)
- [ ] Verify buttons hide/show correctly
- [ ] Check "View Only" badges display for FAMILY users
- [ ] Confirm Compliance tab restriction works
- [ ] Monitor error logs for authorization issues

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete FamilyTab updates** - Add permission guards
2. **Update Sidebar Navigation** - Filter menu items by role
3. **Update Operator Dashboard** - Role-specific metrics and quick actions
4. **Add More Visual Feedback** - Tooltips, help text, contextual messages
5. **Create UI Patterns Documentation** - Developer guide for using permission guards
6. **Comprehensive Testing** - Test all scenarios with all roles
7. **Git Commit & Push** - Commit changes with proper message

---

## Developer Notes

### Using Permission Guards

```tsx
// Import guards
import { PermissionGuard, RoleGuard, ActionGuard } from '@/hooks/usePermissions';
import { PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/permissions';

// For specific permissions
<PermissionGuard permission={PERMISSIONS.RESIDENTS_CREATE}>
  <CreateButton />
</PermissionGuard>

// For resource actions
<ActionGuard resourceType="resident" action="create">
  <CreateButton />
</ActionGuard>

// For roles
<RoleGuard roles={["ADMIN", "OPERATOR"]}>
  <AdminContent />
</RoleGuard>

// With fallback
<PermissionGuard 
  permission={PERMISSIONS.RESIDENTS_UPDATE}
  fallback={<ViewOnlyMessage />}
>
  <EditButton />
</PermissionGuard>
```

### Available Permissions
